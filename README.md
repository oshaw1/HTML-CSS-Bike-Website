# HTML-CSS-Bike-Website
In this web design module, I was tasked with creating a replica of a website that my lecturer had previously designed. The assignment required me to carefully study the layout, design elements, and functionality of the original website, and then use that information to create a new website that closely mimics the original.

To complete the assignment, I used a variety of web design tools, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create the structure and styling of the website. 

One of the biggest challenges of the assignment was ensuring that my replica website looked and functioned as closely as possible to the original. This required me to pay close attention to details such as font choices, color schemes, and button styles, as well as the overall layout and navigational structure of the site.

Overall, the assignment was a great opportunity to practice my web design skills and learn more about how to create a professional-looking and functional website.
